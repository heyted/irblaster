A simple IR blasting script is included that I use with MythTV when recording and watching live TV.  It expects an argument to be included with the irblaster command (done automatically by MythTV).  It sends a power toggle when the first usage of the script includes an argument with a digit to turn the source device on.  Changing the channel can be done by using the command with one or more digits (example: *irblaster 321*).  A power toggle is sent using *irblaster P* to turn the source device off if a previous run of the script included a digit.  The script logs to /tmp/irblaster.log, and it expects the tmp directory to be writable.  LIRC needs to be configured for the digits and having *P* used for the power toggle.  I use this irblaster script with MythTV's external recorder method.

Also, an example configuration file is included that I use with MythTV's external recorder method.  The configuration file calls the irblaster script.
